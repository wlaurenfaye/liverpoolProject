      <div> <p>Lonely Planet, no less, rated Bold Street as one of the best shopping streets in the country, and it’s easy to see why. Book lover? We think you’ll be satisfied amongst the bohemian hardbacks at News from Nowhere and Rennies Art Gallery can show the avid collectors out there what’s what. For quirky designer furniture and unique gifts, look no further than Utility, and head for Resurrection for reworked and branded clothes, or Pop Boutique for the best vintage you can find. </p> </div>
