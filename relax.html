      <div> <p>St.James Mount and Gardens is adjacent to Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, burials continued in the cemetery until July 1936, when, after 57,774 burials, the old cemetery was considered full. During the late 1960's it was decided that action was needed and a plan to turn St James Cemetery into a public garden was proposed. This involved clearing the vast majority of the gravestones and creating an open space. This was completed by 1972.
