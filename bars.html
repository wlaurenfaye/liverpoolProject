      <div> <p> Liverpool is renowned for being an incredible night out. It's true, we can't think of anywhere that lives up to the bars and nightlife in Liverpool. We think that we do pretty well for a few day-time cocktails too. For some day time bubbles take a look at Castle Street or the Royal Albert Dock where you can enjoy your drinks with a side of eye-catching architecture. The Baltic Triangle and Cains Brewery village has a boss up-cycled appeal and is an ideal place for day time or early evening bevvies.  </p> </div>

      <div> <p>Wander just outside of the Liverpool city centre and just opposite the city’s second cathedral is where you’ll find the home of the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra, the ‘Liverpool Phil.’
This is of course the art deco, Grade II listed Philharmonic Hall founded in 1840. When the venue first opened it was without a permanent concert hall. In 1846 the foundation stone was laid and the £30,000 (£2.78m in 2016) permanent concert hall opened in 1849. In 1933 the concert hall was tragically destroyed by a fire, but 6 years later the current hall opened and still stands strong. </p></div>
